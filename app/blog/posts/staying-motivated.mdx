I suffer from the inability to stay focused on one project at a time.

As a result, I have tons of unfinished side projects that I start and end on a whim.

Nevertheless, I'm somehow able to stay focused and regularly work on studio projects, even if I'm not currently being directly compensated for my effort.

Some reasons why I think this is the case:
1. **Pressure to contribute**:
    Working in a team inherently, or well, socially, motivates or incentivizes you to do work, lest you face criticism or disappointment, feeling left behind, etc.

2. **Visible Goals**:
    Having a task tracker, like using GitHub projects and issues, helps to visualize what you've done, what's left to do, etc. It's a bit like an RPG game, checking off quests as you merge pull requests.

3. **Shared Progress**:
    Showing off the work that you've done can be pretty satisfying. In a social context, sharing what everyone is working on promotes "togetherness", and encourages everyone to do cool things.

4. **Deadlines and Milestones**:
    Upcoming events, like playtests, exhibitions, festivals (e.g. Steam Next Fests), etc. set a limited timeline to achieve the team's shared goals. 
    
    This provides an incentive to actually do work, instead of procrastinating, since there's pressure to finish work on time, unless you want to be swamped or burn out.

5. **Hopes and Dreams**:
    The team hopes that this project will finally be their big break, monetary incentive is always a powerful pushing force, as well as fame, recognition, status, and "success".

    No one wants to stay in the rat race forever.
