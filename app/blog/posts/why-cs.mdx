summary: 'My life story.'
---

Growing up, I really liked playing Minecraft, and it was probably Minecraft that eventually lead to me becoming a Software Engineer.

This is the story of how a dumb kid somehow got into IT because he liked games, probably quite a common story, to be honest.

As a kid, I really liked playing around with Minecraft mods and plugins, particularly CraftBukkit plugins, which were plugins you could install onto a server to add cool features like shops, guns, mini-games, etc.

Although I managed to get my own Minecraft server up and running at the tender age of 12, complete with port forwarding, I wasn't smart enough to figure out how to write my own plugins.

It's hard to say whether the frustration from my lack-of-plugin-making-capabilities was what eventually drove me to choose IT as my diploma of choice, but I like to believe that it had significant influence.

All I can say now is that, after taking my GCE O'Levels, I really wanted to become a programmer.

I didn't really care about my exact career path at the time, I just wanted to learn to code, and learn to code I did.

This fact basically threw any thoughts I had about joining a Junior College out of the window.

In hindsight, the fact that my brother was a programmer likely had an influence as well.

One time, he showed me a simple game he made in HTML5, a simple tile-based 2D JRPG prototype.

I was already studying for my IT diploma at this point, but it was likely this experience that eventually lead me to pursue game development seriously, first as an elective, then as a degree, and now finally, as a career path.

## Dawn
About a week before I stepped into the Ngee Ann Polytechnic campus, I scanned the course brochure and discovered that I would be learning Python.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try learning it on my own. After all, in the digital age, you can theoretically learn anything by looking it up online.

The first actual program that I wrote, that wasn't just a Hello World, was also the very first game that I made.

It was a simple guessing game, a common stepping stone for most developers, but one that basically set in stone my desire to write software.

I made it through a couple chapters of Python tutorials, many of which were on W3Schools, before school started, giving me a huge head start on the programming aspect of software development.

Most modules were a breeze, as almost everything was interesting. However, I was horrible at math, barely getting a C for just about all my math modules.

## Arrogance
They say that arrogance is the downfall of men.

I fell, hard.

After acing all my programming modules, I felt on top of the world, untouchable, like a god.

My naivet√© lead me to believe that I could do anything software related, so cocksure I was.

Inevitably, my complacency would destroy me.

## Waste
My attitude lead me to squander my internship opportunities. Rather than making an informed decision, I simply selected the most appealing internship position.

Without considering whether I even had the qualifications, I opted for an internship at Samsung, for what I thought was an AI development role.

I got the interview, dressed myself up and went in thinking that the job was in the bag, how could they possibly refuse me?

Alas, I had nothing concrete to show but empty promises.

I was rejected from the role, not big surprise.

As a result of my bad decisions, I eventually ended up as a manual tester at CrimsonLogic. 

Funnily enough, I thought I was going to be a Software Developer, yet another consequence of my carefree attitude and complacency.

## Misery
The 6 months I spent as a manual tester were some of the most miserable months of my life. I hated my job, the people were nice, but the job was the epitome of mundane.

It was soul-draining, every day was a similar routine, testing, testing and more testing.

It didn't help that I was suffering from a debilitating skin issue, my skin was incredibly dry and itchy. I had difficultly sleeping and was in constant pain.

Fortunately, every cloud has a silver lining, I had the opportunity to work on automation testing for a bit, learning about Selenium Webdriver, and getting to touch the ancient version control tool that is TortoiseSVN.

I eventually ended up making my own macro tool using AutoHotKey, for the really tedious tasks like documenting the testing process. 

Printscreen, tab to Microsoft Word, paste, and repeat. My macro script saved me from going insane.

I didn't share my tool initially, as I was afraid of getting into trouble. After all, when you're using a macro, is it really still manual testing?

In hindsight, it probably doesn't matter.

I eventually shared the tool with some close friends, fellow interns doing the same soul-sucking job, and I didn't get fired so all is well I guess.

## Redemption
After my internship, having mostly learned my lesson, I went on to develop a rhythm game for my final year project with a group of friends.

I was obsessed with osu!mania at this stage of my life, regularly grinding to hone my skills, and for that sweet sweet dopamine rush when I see my ranking go up.

The game I developed was a bootleg clone of osu!mania made in Unity with a twist, the game doubles as a beatmap editor, where users can create maps by organically "playing" through a song.

User key presses would be recorded and saved into the beatmap, allowing them to create a beatmap entirely through "playing".

To achieve this, copied the file format from mania and stripped it down to the bare minimum. No fancy keysounds here, just note timings.

Things were going pretty well, we had a decent prototype that could play some heavily processed osu!mania maps.

Unfortunately, I got complacent (again) during the holidays, practically not touching the project at all.

As a result, we fell behind during the final stretch, we had a functional product, but it was severely lacking in polish.

We still got a pretty good grade though, it's just that the final product left much to be desired, and ultimately left me feeling disappointed and regretful for not putting in more effort.

## Jack of all Tech, Master of Nothing
Up until today, I find great difficultly in choosing one specialization to stick to.

Although game development is my main passion, I still enjoy developing in other fields too. Like this blog, for example.

I have a bad habit of starting unfinished projects, projects that typically start out strong, then fizzle out quickly, like gas from a soda.
