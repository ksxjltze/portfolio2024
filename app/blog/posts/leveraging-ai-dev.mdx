Wait wait, before you start bringing out the pitchforks, hear me out.

Now, using solely AI to generate code and do everything for you, I'm pretty sure most of us can agree that it doesn't do us much good in the long run.

Sure, you might get a working product in a pretty short amount of time, but chances are that you won't fully understand what it's doing, which will inevitably come back to bite you later on.

However, pretending that AI isn't here to stay isn't realistic either. Generative AI has already irreversibly changed how we code, how we think and even how we learn.

It's nearly impossible to go back, and by not utilizing it, you're putting yourself at a huge disadvantage, even with all of the pitfalls that come from relying on AI.

My point is, Generative AI LLMs like ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, etc. are just a tool, an immensely useful one if you know how to use it right.

WIP:
- Copilot and forgetting how to write syntax
- Hallucinations can be helpful
- Never take an LLM's words at face value
- Using an LLM like a search engine
- Cross-referencing is key
- Using AI as a jumping pad
- The art of struggle and gitting gud
