summary: 'Interdisciplinary fields, interdisciplinary skills, I wanna be good at everything.'

Have you ever met someone who just seemed to know everything? They seem to be able to do anything, the world is their oyster, they do what they want and get what they want.

Sounds a little idealistic? Yea, it is, but that is precisely the kind of person that I want to be, someone who can shape their own destiny with their own two hands, making the best, of what they've got.

I know my writing is cringe, but bear with me.

## Pareto Principle

There's this thing called the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), which states that roughly 80% of outcomes come from 20% of the causes.

Or another way of looking at it is, you only need to know about 20% of a particular skill to extract about 80% of the use from it.

Now this isn't a concrete rule, but it drives a simple and powerful message, you don't need to know EVERYTHING to do ANYTHING.

## Everything you do, makes you better
Have you ever stopped doing something for a while, only to come back later and discover that you're suddenly somehow better at it?

I'm sure there are plently of studies and debates out there about why this is, ranging from things like stress, burnout, creativity, energy, etc.

This may be a strange take, but I'm fairly convinced that the brain does some kind of magic when we're trying other things.
