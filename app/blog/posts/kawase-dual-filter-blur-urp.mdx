A Kawase blur is better performing, close approximation of a Gaussian blur.

An even faster implementation, dubbed "Dual filter", a.k.a Dual Kawase Blur, is introduced in a 2015 SIGGRAPH talk by Marius Bj√∏rge.

It utilizes downsampling and upsampling with different filtering kernels to achieve a Kawase blur effect, but at a significantly lower cost.

While intended to be used for bloom, this can also be used directly as a blur filter.
