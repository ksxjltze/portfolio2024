I love me some curry and cheese, and I love me some rice. 

This will probably be blasphemy to some people, but here's a makeshift "risotto" "recipe" that I just can't stop making, inspired by [Charlie Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElbm2CmNJE).

## Ingredients:
- 1tbsp Curry Powder/(Garam Masala + Tumeric)
- Whatever other spices you feel like adding
- Any kind of stock/broth (I like mushroom stock)
- A pinch of salt, or a tsp of soy sauce
- Onions, tomatoes and garlic
- Rice
- 1tbsp Vinegar
- Olive Oil
- Anything else you can find in your fridge (Legumes, Veggies, etc.)
- 1tbsp Full Fat Greek Yogurt
- CHEESE

## Notes:
- Use 1 cup of broth for every half a cup of rice (1 to 2 Ratio of Rice to Liquid).
- Rice vinegar goes well with rice
- Don't wash the rice if you want it to be more sticky

## Steps:
1. Heat a deep skillet or pan on medium-high heat
2. Coat the pan with oil
3. Add spices, toast until it smells good
4. Add rice, toast until not burnt
5. Add your onions/tomatoes/garlic, or other sauce base, and vinegar
6. Spread and stir or toss everything for a bit
7. Add the stock/broth when you feel ready
8. Give it a good mix, then cover and let it simmer on low-ish heat
9. Stir ocassionally, and add all your other stuff (veggies, beans, etc.) when you feel like it
10. Anywhere from 10-30 minutes later, when it starts to look less soupy and more saucy, add in the yogurt and CHEESE
11. Mix, mix, swirl, mix
12. Turn off heat and simmer covered, or don't, until the rice reaches desired consistency
13. Add oil or butter for a nice finish
14. Garnish with coriander maybe
15. Serve

## It should probably look something like this at the end:
