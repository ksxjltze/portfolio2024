Have you heard of the great Dororong?

See the [Dororong](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dororong).

Reddit [Memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/NikkeMobile/comments/1gmbg6a/hi_im_new_to_the_sub_and_i_would_like_to_see_your/).

A sudden stroke of inspiration struck me when I saw this meme. 

I have been inspired to learn to draw, so that I may one day freely draw doros of my own.

I'll be using Krita, because I heard it's good, and using a wacom tablet that I bought for osu!
