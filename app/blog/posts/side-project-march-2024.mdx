It's time for yet another unfinished side project.

# Gamified Task Tracker
I love leveling up, I want to see number go up when I finish thing.

__Introducing__: AI Assisted Gamified Task and Skill Tracker 2025 Edition

## Tentative Stack
- Rendering: Lynx
- AI Assistant: Ollama
- Vector DB: pgvector

## What it do
- Ask AI to grade you to get a baseline for your skills
- AI Generated Tasks, tell AI that you want to git gud at something, and ask it to generate goals and projects to work towards.
- Skill Tree
- Locally hosted by default

## Doesn't this already exist?
[Habitica](https://habitica.com/) exists, but it doesn't use AI to grill you, and it's not locally hosted.
