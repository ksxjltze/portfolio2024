Recently I've been thinking about that one experimental clicker game that I played when I was but a wee secondary school student:

[Wikipedia - Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity:_What%27s_Inside_the_Cube%3F)

I vaguely remember that the "ending" was rather underwhelming, but for a while, it was a pretty fun time waster, just tapping away at a cube, watching the numbers change.

## New Month, New Side Project
It's time (UPDATE: **nope**) for yet another unfinished, probably-mostly-going-to-be-unstarted side project.

It'd be cool to make a collaborative time waster.

## How to make an MMO as a solo dev?
Making a massively multiplayer, pseudo-realtime(?) game is a huge undertaking for a solo developer though.

Fortunately, there's this new shiny thing called SpacetimeDB, now looks like a good time to actually try it out and see if it lives up to the hype.

Ignoring the whole "life-changing" experience part, what I want to replicate is simply the multiplayer experience of wasting time together on a shared goal(s).

## What happened to the game in the end?
Here's a cool video about the aftermath of the "experiment":
