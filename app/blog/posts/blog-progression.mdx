This website of mine started out pretty bare bones, I just yoinked a nextjs blog starter template because I didn't want to re-invent the wheel for the third time.

So here's a short list of what I've added so far (in no particular order):
- Blog Article Sorting
- Command Panel
- Theme Switching
- Sandpack
- Article View Modes (Grid, List, Cards)
- Article Search by Title (and summary)

Here's what I plan to add in the future:
- Article Filter by Tags
- Canvas Overlay for visual effects
- Forms for various purposes
- Maybe a comments section
- Contact me form
- Embedded games
- 3D model viewer
- Article view counter
- Featured posts
- Sidebar Menu for mobile
- AI Search

It'll take a while, but slowly chipping at it keeps the flame going.
