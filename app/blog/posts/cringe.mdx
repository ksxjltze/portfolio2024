I cringe at every article/blog post that I write, but I don't let that stop me.
Embrace the cringe, for it just might make you a better person (hopefully).

Looking back on my past actions makes me cringe, it happens a lot more often than I'd like.

For example, I thought my first website was cool, now it makes me cringe.

I thought my second website was cool too, now it makes me cringe even more than the first one.

I'll probably find this one cringe too, eventually.

However, if I let the cringe stop me, or rather, if I let the fear of being cringe hold me back, I'll never get anything cool done.

Let the cringe fuel you.
