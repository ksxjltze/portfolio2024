Making games on the web these days is incredibly easy, so let's make it difficult (relatively) by using WebGPU!

A 2D game shouldn't be too difficult, right?

## Stuff needed from/for/using WebGPU
- Vertex Buffers
- Vertex Shader
- Fragment Shader
- Texture Sampling
- Uniforms
- Matrix Math
- Instancing

## My Tech "Stack"
- Supabase: DB, WebSockets, "Backend", Auth
- WebGPU: Rendering, and possibly Compute
- Angular: Frontend Client, and Routing
- Vercel: Hosting

## Engine Stuff
- Input System
- Tilemap Editor
- 2D Rendering (WebGPU)
- Sprite Sheet Animation
- Some kind of Behaviour Architecture (ECS, etc.)
- Event Bus/PubSub System

## Game Mechanics
- Top Down ARPG (kinda)
- Incremental Gameplay of some kind
- Base Building
- Skill Tree and stuff
- Doro Generator (Character Customization)

## How to manage scope?
Who knows, just do a bit every day.

# Dev Log

**May 29 2025** - 500 lines of code later, we have a spinning doro:

At this point, we have a working basic WebGPU renderer, and can draw single images to the screen. It is however, extremely rudimentary.

    <source src="/videos/dororong/dowo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**June 6 2025** - Primitive Input and Tilemap:

With the help of instancing and storage buffers, we now have a working Tile Map. I also added some simple input to move the player sprite around.

For now, it's all just grass tiles.

    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**June 12 2025** - Sprite Sheet Animation

Many files later.. and a lot of refactoring/abstraction:

Doro can now animates, poggers.

<video width="600" height="300" controls preload="false" autoPlay={false} loop={true}>
    <source src="/videos/doro-tower/spritesheet.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

At this point, DoroEngine™ has behaviour systems, Sprite Sheets, Input, 2D Rendering, etc. Not too shabby.

Side Note: I can't figure out how to get rid of the browser keyboard sounds in code, so I'll just live with it I guess.

## Stuff used for 2D Animation (so far)
- Texture Atlas for sprite sheet animation
- UV Offsets
- "ECS" System for game logic

## Stuff I wanted to use but failed to
- Texture Arrays: Either WebGPU doesn't support texture arrays or a '2d-array' texture view isn't what I think it is, cause it just doesn't work.

**June 20 2025** - Tile Map Editor

After a lot of fiddling with matrix math, a lot of refactoring, abstracting, and finally getting orthographic projection to work properly, we now have a working tile map editor.
Saved using localStorage (for now).

It also has panning (not shown in video), also the black borders around each tile are for debugging purposes, to ensure that each tile is actually aligned correctly.

Getting the math working for this was a lot more work than expected, firstly because memory padding is a pain to think about, but also because I was too lazy to implement projection initially.

Orthographic Projection actually makes it a lot easier to reason about the math in code. Partially because I chose to convert my engine transform coordinates from clip-space (which it was initially), to pixel space or screen space.

As a result of that, I can easily define one unit, or one tile, as a fixed pixel size, e.g. 64px. Using this unit consistently makes the math a lot less painful to work through.

**June 22 2025** - Authentication and User Profile

With the help of Supabase, we now have user accounts, I contemplated using SpacetimeDB, and Spring for the backend; cost-wise, Supabase seems to be the best choice. 

Also, I really don't feel like touching Kubernetes right now.

Supabase is also probably the least effort to get up and running (for now).

Read more about how to use Supabase with Angular [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-angular).

## What's next?

Some actual gameplay probably?

I've decided to start with some simple incremental gameplay. 

Doro collects Doro Particles™ (DP) from the void passively, and can upgrade her Doro Drive™ to collect DP faster.

After that, I'll probably implement some simple chat and multiplayer using WebSockets.

## TODO:
A lot..

STAY TUNED FOR THE BEST DORO GAME YOU'VE EVER SEEN (from me).
