summary: 'The struggles of reconnecting with one's mother tongue.'
---

For the longest time, I had always thought that my mother tongue would be useless, especially in a society like Singapore where the English language dominates nearly every facet of life.

However, as I've grown older and wiser, I have come to realize the importance of one's native language when it comes to self-identity, career prospects, social life, etc.

There is no good reason to dismiss one's mother tongue, whether one ends up using it or not.

Unfortunately, as an individual of ethnic chinese descent, my procifiency in my native language is devastatingly poor.

I grew up in a family that largely communicates in English, I talk to my friends in English, I consume media in English, I study in English.

From the time that we are first enrolled into school, all the way until we graduate from university, the primary medium of communication and learning is Standard Singapore English.

As we are gradually shaped by our educational environment growing up, we have grown accustomed to leaving our native tongue by the wayside. At least, this has been my personal experience.

So how can a banana ripen itself? To metamorphose from a pretentious shell that envelops a white fleshy inside, into something much greater?

I do not know the answer. Right now, all I can say for myself is that I have just begun my journey to rediscover myself and my native tongue.

Engaging with chinese media, such as books, video games, manhwa, videos and movies; improving my capabilities by using a dictionary, working through mock exams and expanding my vocabularly using language learning apps.
Mixing up my inner monologue with mandarin chinese, setting goals for myself, etc. 

Eventually, hopefully, I can achieve procifiency in a language that I once thought to discard.

End of cringe, thank you for reading my first blog post.
