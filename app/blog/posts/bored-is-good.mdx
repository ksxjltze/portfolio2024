I dread traveling, I especially dislike those guided tours where you sit on a bus for hours, being shuttled from point of interest A to B. 

If the content of the tour wasn't dry enough, the long hours of just doing nothing is often enough to drive me insane.

However, it is during these times of absolute mundanity that some of my most creative ideas spring to life.

They say that traveling broadens the mind, broadens the horizons, or something along those lines. 
I have come to appreciate this saying, because I think that it holds true regardless of whether you enjoy the trip or not.
