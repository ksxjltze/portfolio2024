I dread traveling, I especially dislike those guided tours where you sit on a bus for hours, being shuttled from point of interest A to B. 

If the content of the tour wasn't dry enough, the long hours of just doing nothing is often enough to drive me insane.

However, it is during these times of absolute mundanity that some of my most creative ideas spring to life.

They say that traveling broadens the mind, broadens the horizons, or something along those lines. 
I have come to appreciate this saying, because I think that it holds true regardless of whether you enjoy the trip or not.

Try it out for yourself, just sit in an empty room, or at the park, somewhere without your phone, and just stare blankly into space. You'd be surprised just how quickly your mind comes up with interesting ideas.

Take the time to have a moment of self reflection, and do some deep Introspection. Assess your current situation and how you can use it, or navigate it, to improve yourself or achieve your goals.

On an unrelated note, Sandpack is cool.
