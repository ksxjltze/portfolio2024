# Idea 1: Cooking Game
I want to make a game that kinda teaches people how to actually cook, not just mashing together a bunch of ingredients in a menu and clicking a button.

## It should at least cover:
1. Taste fundamentals: salty, sweet, bitter, umami.
2. Aromatics
3. Maillard Reaction
4. Deglazing
5. Salt, fat, acid, heat
6. Ingredient preparation
7. Heat control and timing

Damn, a lot actually goes into cooking.
This would be cool as a VR game of sorts, running your own kitchen or restaurant.

## Possible Gameplay Progression:
1. Start out as a stand seller.
2. Upgrade to bigger establishments (food truck, hawker stall, etc.)
3. Hire workers to automate side processes like ingredients, customers, etc.
4. BIG MONEY, BIG PROFIT
5. Take over the world with food

## Tuning it down a bit
Let's maybe start with something simpler, but still targeted for VR, how about an egg-flipping game, all you do is flip eggs and make various egg-related dishes. 

Slowly upgrading your equipment and recipes to be more "eggstraordinary", "eggsceptional" and "eggscellent".

Why VR? Why not, who doesn't want to try an immersive egg flipping simulator?

## 3D Models
Here are some free blender files for the crappy 3D models I made on a whim for this:

- [Skillet](/blender/frying-pan.blend)
- [Table](/blender/table.blend)

## Resources
- [Elements of Good Cooking](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/)
- [How to VR in Unity](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/vr-development)
- [VR Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VROverview.html)

# Idea 2: Calorie Tracker
I've been thinking, how accurate are LLMs are estimating calories from images? If I feed a picture of the meal I cooked into ChatGPT, can it tell me somewhat accurately about what I'm eating?

If it can, then boy do I have a new "totally original" app idea.

Apps like MyFitnessPal exist for calorie tracking, but I could never really get into it.

Perhaps simplifying the process into simply taking a photo could help motivate me to actually start counting my calories.

Update: Turns out this already exists, check out [Journable](https://www.journable.com/).

# Idea 3: Make a computer vision bot play games
There's this cool thingy called [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/), a cutting-edge deep learning and computer vision model.

People have used it for things like football tracking, here's a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/neBZ6huolkg?feature=shared) using Ultralytics and YOLOv8, among other machine learning thingies to analyze football matches.

Neat.

Machine learning is arguably one of my weakest areas, so this project would be a pretty good learning adventure.

Also, possibly an avenue to kinda publicize games through a technical dev log of some sort maybe.

My "plan" would be to build a bot to play [Playing God](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165320/Playing_God/), a game that I've helped to develop for RATHSOFT. Watching an AI bot speed through a precision platformer ought to be pretty satisfying.

# Idea 4: Put an idle game on my blog
I've been wanting to make an online idle game for a while, but I've always put it off because of other projects and I didn't really want to commit to it until I was more "free".

Instead of making a full game in a game engine like Unity, why not just make a simple one that I can put on my website? 

I have a lot of options here for rendering that don't involve Unity and WebGL: plain HTML5, CSS canvas, ThreeJS, three-react-fiber, BabylonJS, or even WebGPU.

I'm leaning towards WebGPU because it's cutting edge and really cool, the only real concern is browser support.

# Idea 5: Custom Discord Bot
I've been thinking about how to grow the community for the studio I work at.

While we do have a Discord server, we've honestly been neglecting the management of it, not engaging much with our tiny community.

My idea is to create a custom bot to drive engagement and stuff, it should have gamified features for users mess around with.

A good reference point would probably be existing bots like MEE6 and Dyno.

Why not just use these? Well, for starters, they can't access the Steam Web API (probably), and we can always run multiple bots together.

## Features
- Leaderboard
- Game Stats (e.g. Query Steam Web API to fetch Playing God stats)
- Level System (Gain XP for engaging with the server)
- Minigames
- Announcements
- Custom Emotes/Gifs/Stickers/Images/etc..
- Game Information (update announcements, active players, etc.)
- Social Media Hooks
- Etc..

If we do decide to make our own bot, it's going to be a lot of work, but it'll probably be worth it down the line.
