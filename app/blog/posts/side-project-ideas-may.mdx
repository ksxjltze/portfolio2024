# Idea 1: Cooking Game
I want to make a game that kinda teaches people how to actually cook, not just mashing together a bunch of ingredients in a menu and clicking a button.

## It should at least cover:
1. Taste fundamentals: salty, sweet, bitter, umami.
2. Aromatics
3. Maillard Reaction
4. Deglazing
5. Salt, fat, acid, heat
6. Ingredient preparation
7. Heat control and timing

Damn, a lot actually goes into cooking.
This would be cool as a VR game of sorts, running your own kitchen or restaurant.

## Possible Gameplay Progression:
1. Start out as a stand seller.
2. Upgrade to bigger establishments (food truck, hawker stall, etc.)
3. Hire workers to automate side processes like ingredients, customers, etc.
4. BIG MONEY, BIG PROFIT
5. Take over the world with food

## Tuning it down a bit
Let's maybe start with something simpler, but still targeted for VR, how about an egg-flipping game, all you do is flip eggs.
