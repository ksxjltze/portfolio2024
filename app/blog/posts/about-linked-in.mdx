Aside from the obvious networking benefits. LinkedIn as a social media platform is actually quite useful for finding useful tips and tricks in fields that you have an interest in.

As a result of its professional nature, people are incentivized to share their expertise, or show off their work on the platform.

I'd just like to say, that you can take advantage of this to get useful inspiration, knowledge, news, etc. straight from experts in your industry.

## Tuning your algorithm
Like and repost (or even better, comment on) interesting posts to "encourage" the suggestion algorithm to give you more useful posts, rather than the "usual" self promotion and marketing spiel.

If you didn't know, LinkedIn also has a "Save" feature, allowing you to save interesting posts for reviewing later.

Better to doomscroll some useful knowledge once in a while rather than looking at memes all day, amirite?
