summary: 'What do I actually want to be?'

There comes a time in every computer science undergraduate's life when they find themselves face to face with the crossroads of tech.

"What should I pick as my career path? "

Data analysis? Full-stack Development? Cloud Engineering? DevOps? AI?

The list goes on and on.

In these trying times, it seems ever more daunting to break into the tech industry. 
Every job opening has hundreds of applicants, and the flood of experienced engineers from industry layoffs isn't helping our chances.

Some positions expect you to know everything under the sun, while others just need you to know a smidge of javascript, but it doesn't matter since you'll probably end up being ghosted by both anyway.

Perhaps the real question is, do I really need to work in tech?

There are (should be) plenty of companies out there that aren't directly involved in the tech industry, but still require the skills of a software engineer for various operations.

The wiser choice is likely to stop fixating solely on tech jobs and to cast a wider net. Unfortunately, whether one enjoys working in other industries is another question entirely.

Personally, I quite enjoy developing games and building systems around them. However, it is sad to say, but the path of a game developer rarely puts enough food on the table.

The crossroads are fast approaching.

Perservere, wait and hope.
