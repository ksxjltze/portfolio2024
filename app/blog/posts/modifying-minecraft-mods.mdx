Recently, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft. Specifically, modded Minecraft, using a custom modpack for Cobblemon.

A friend of mine hosts a multiplayer server on the Apex hosting platform, but has given me access to administrate the server in case issues arise.

Unfortunately, issues do arise, and fairly frequently, particularly involving mod crashes.

To fix these, I usually have to either edit player data, or world data, using an Named Binary Tag (NBT) editor.

Doing so however, does not address the root cause of the issue, which is usually caused by the mod developers forgetting to add error handling somewhere.

Modifying a Minecraft mod may seem daunting at first, but is actually pretty easy when using the correct tools.

## Recaf
One such tool, is [Recaf](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf) by coley, a modern Java bytecode editor.

Recaf is capable of both decompilation and recompilation, which means that, to some extent, the source code of the mod can be reconstructed and viewed.

Recaf can also deobfuscate code, using various mappings.

Unfortunately, during my adventures, I failed to recompile my edited Java source code, so I had to resort to editing the bytecode directly.

## Energized Power Crash
For some reason, the solar panel from the Energized Power mod tried to extract a negative amount of energy from itself, which triggered an unhandled IllegalArgumentException, causing the server to crash.

To fix this, all one needs to do is clamp the values between 0 and the provided amount, preventing negative values from ever occuring.

The reconstructed source code for the crashing function in question:

Unfortunately, after coding in the fix, I failed to compile the modified code due to missing libraries, which I found to be too much of a pain to resolve.

So instead, I resorted to editing the bytecode directly, which is like, assembler/assembly for the Java programming language.

### Original Bytecode Snippet

I don't know Java bytecode, so I enlisted the help of an LLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash) to speed things up, like everyone does these days.

```
A:
    line 61
    lload maxAmount
    lconst_0
    lcmp
    ifge MOD_SKIP_CLAMP
    lconst_0
    lstore maxAmount
MOD_SKIP_CLAMP:
    lload maxAmount
    invokestatic net/fabricmc/fabric/api/transfer/v1/storage/StoragePreconditions.notNegative (J)V
```

And viola, it no longer crashes.
