As a relatively recent graduate, I've observed some interesting trends among my fellow former undergraduates, relating to how they approach the education system, and their apparent goals.

There appear to be two main "camps" of students:
1. The passionate, do-goer, ambitious type.
2. The minimal-effort, just-wants-the-degree type.

Arguably, both types are naive.

One probably believes that all of their effort will pay off, landing them a dream job, and that success is just around the corner if they work just a little harder.

The other believes that the piece of paper we call a degree certificate is a one-way-street to a guaranteed cushy, stable, high-paying job.

Regardless of which camp a student falls into, the education system does not adequately prepare them for the crushing reality that is entering the work force.

## The emergence of AI-dependence
AI Chatbots, LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, etc. are a game changer in the field of education. For better or for worse, information, whether factual or otherwise, is more easily accessible today than it ever was.

When ChatGPT was first released to the public, I was in my second year of undergraduate studies; immediately, everyone started to use it for everything: homework, assignments, sometimes even exams (open-book exams have never been easier).

In my opinion, AI Chatbots have further polarized the divide between go-getters and cruise-by-ers. It is easier now than ever before to "float through" school, any semblance of critical thinking can be delegated to LLMs, allowing any student to pass their modules with minimum effort.

LLMs are useful, don't get me wrong, but developing a reliance on them simply sets you up for failure. Sometime in the future, when the LLM is unable to generate a solution to a specific niche problem or particular situation, one who relies so heavily on them would find themselves at an incredible loss.
