As a relatively recent graduate, I've observed some interesting trends among my fellow former undergraduates, relating to how they approach the education system, and their apparent goals.

There appear to be two main "camps" of students:
1. The passionate, do-goer, ambitious type.
2. The minimal-effort, just-wants-the-degree type.

Arguably, both types are naive.

One probably believes that all of their effort will pay off, landing them a dream job, and that success if just around the corner if they work just a little harder.

The other believes that the piece of paper we call a degree certificate is a one-way-street to a guaranteed cushy, stable, high-paying job.

Regardless of which camp a student falls into, the education system does not adequately prepare them for the crushing reality that is entering the work force.
