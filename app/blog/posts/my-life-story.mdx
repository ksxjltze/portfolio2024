summary: 'My life story.'
---

Time for a story, or rather, incoherent ramblings about my life. This post won't be very structured, it's really just a messy reflection of the path that I have chosen.

## Minecraft

Growing up, I really liked playing Minecraft, and it was probably Minecraft that eventually lead to me becoming a Software Engineer.

This is the story of how a dumb kid somehow got into IT because he liked games, probably quite a common story, to be honest.

As a kid, I really liked playing around with Minecraft mods and plugins, particularly CraftBukkit plugins, which were plugins you could install onto a server to add cool features like shops, guns, mini-games, etc.

Although I managed to get my own Minecraft server up and running at the tender age of 12, complete with port forwarding, I wasn't smart enough to figure out how to write my own plugins.

It's hard to say whether the frustration from my lack-of-plugin-making-capabilities was what eventually drove me to choose IT as my diploma of choice, but I like to believe that it had significant influence.

## Early Education
I may be Malaysian born and raised, but my entire educational background has been a Singaporean one. From primary school, all the way to graduating from university.

## Information Technology
After taking my GCE O'Levels, I really wanted to become a programmer, and I wanted to work with computers.

I didn't really care about my exact career path at the time, I just wanted to learn to code, and learn to code I did.

This fact basically threw any thoughts I had about joining a Junior College out of the window, and I ended up enrolling for a Diploma in Information Technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore.

## Exposure to Programming
In hindsight, the fact that my brother was a programmer likely had an influence as well.

One time, he showed me a simple game he made in HTML5, a simple tile-based 2D JRPG prototype.

I was already studying for my IT diploma at this point, but it was likely this experience that eventually lead me to pursue game development seriously, first as an elective, then as a degree, and now finally, as a career path.

# Dawn: Ngee Ann Polytechnic
About a week before I stepped into the Ngee Ann Polytechnic campus, I scanned the course brochure and discovered that I would be learning Python.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to try learning it on my own. After all, in the digital age, you can theoretically learn anything by looking it up online.

The first actual program that I wrote, that wasn't just a Hello World, was also the very first game that I made.

It was a simple guessing game, a common stepping stone for most developers, but one that basically set in stone my desire to write software.

I made it through a couple chapters of Python tutorials, many of which were on W3Schools, before school started, giving me a huge head start on the programming aspect of software development.

Most modules were a breeze, as almost everything was interesting. However, I was horrible at math, barely getting a C for just about all my math modules.

## Game Development
I was mostly just floating through the modules, until I was given the opportunity to select Game Development as one of my electives, and down that tree I went.

It was this choice, instead of going down the Big Data or Machine Learning route that eventually lead me to enroll at DigiPen after receiving my Diploma.

All in all, I found myself doing quite well for myself, however..

## Arrogance
They say that arrogance is the downfall of men, and fall I did. I fell, hard.

After acing just about all my programming modules, I felt on top of the world, untouchable, like a god.

My naivet√© lead me to believe that I could do anything, I could learn any technology, I thought I could build anything with my own two hands. 

I guess this is what they call the Software Engineer superiority complex.

Either way, inevitably, my complacency would destroy me.

## Waste
My attitude lead me to squander my internship opportunities. Rather than making an informed decision, I simply selected the most appealing internship position.

Without considering whether I even had the qualifications, I opted for an internship at Samsung, for what I thought was an AI development role.

I got the interview, dressed myself up and went in thinking that the job was in the bag, how could they possibly refuse me?

Alas, I had nothing concrete to show but empty promises.

I was rejected from the role, not big surprise.

As a result of my bad decisions, I eventually ended up as a manual tester at CrimsonLogic. 

Funnily enough, I thought I was going to be a Software Developer, yet another consequence of my carefree attitude and complacency.

## Misery
The 6 months I spent as a manual tester were some of the most miserable months of my life. I hated my job, the people were nice, but the job was the epitome of mundane.

It was soul-draining, every day was a similar routine, testing, testing and more testing.

It didn't help that I was suffering from a debilitating skin issue, my skin was incredibly dry and itchy. I had difficultly sleeping and was in constant pain.

Fortunately, every cloud has a silver lining, I had the opportunity to work on automation testing for a bit, learning about Selenium Webdriver, and getting to touch the ancient version control tool that is TortoiseSVN.

I eventually ended up making my own macro tool using AutoHotKey, for the really tedious tasks like documenting the testing process. 

Printscreen, tab to Microsoft Word, paste, and repeat. My macro script saved me from going insane.

I didn't share my tool initially, as I was afraid of getting into trouble. After all, when you're using a macro, is it really still manual testing?

In hindsight, it probably doesn't matter.

I eventually shared the tool with some close friends, fellow interns doing the same soul-sucking job, and I didn't get fired so all is well I guess.

## Redemption?
After my internship, having mostly learned my lesson, I went on to develop a rhythm game for my final year project with a group of friends.

I was obsessed with a game called osu!mania at this stage of my life, regularly grinding to hone my skills, and for that sweet sweet dopamine rush when I see my ranking go up.

The game I developed was a bootleg clone of osu!mania made in Unity with a twist, the game doubles as a beatmap editor, where users can create maps by organically "playing" through a song.

User key presses would be recorded and saved into the beatmap, allowing them to create a beatmap entirely through "playing".

To achieve this, copied the file format from mania and stripped it down to the bare minimum. No fancy keysounds here, just note timings.

Things were going pretty well, we had a decent prototype that could play some heavily processed osu!mania maps.


## Complacency (again)
Unfortunately, I got complacent (again) during the holidays, practically not touching the project at all.

As a result, we fell behind during the final stretch, we had a functional product, but it was severely lacking in polish.

We still got a pretty good grade though, it's just that the final product left much to be desired, and ultimately left me feeling disappointed and regretful for not putting in more effort.

# DigiPen
## Junior Year
DigiPen taught me a lot. I thought I understood Software Engineering before, boy was I wrong, I didn't know a thing.

I already knew how to code, but my junior year at DigiPen made me actually understand why my code even works in the first place.

Memory management, code compilation, assembly, bits, computer hardware architecture, etc.

I felt enlightened.

## GAM
A.K.A The Software Engineering Project

During my batch, DigiPen offered 6 modules of software engineering projects, split into one trimester each.

Students are required to gather in teams, brainstorm project ideas, and implement them to completion, or at least, complete enough to satisfy the rubrics.

These software engineering modules were my favourite part of the DigiPen curriculum, as they put all your technical (and communication/teamwork) skills right through the grinder.

The freedom to build just about anything you want, is the most liberating form of educational assessment that I have ever experienced. Well, anything as long as it was part of a game/game engine/simulation.

## Applied Mathematics
This was the first time I actually enjoyed learning Maths. For the first time, I could directly see the applications, how I could use Linear Algebra and Calculus in my code to manipulate a virtual world.

## USA
So, everyone has the opportunity to go overseas for a trimester-long exchange program during their senior year at DigiPen. For my cohort, we could only choose to go to the U.S of A, because COVID.

So what did we do there?

Well, I got really fat, like +10kg fatter, and I was strangely unmotivated to really do anything but eat. 

Possibly because it was an overseas exchange program, but studying ended up taking a backseat and I ended up treating most of the trip like a holiday.

Which is a pity, because the professors and modules over there were stellar, I just didn't make the most of it. Not to say that I didn't learn anything of course, just that I could have engaged with the material so much more, if not for the strange mental state that I was in.

## Burnout
I've never felt so burned out, juggling the cramped time table together with the copious number of projects pushed me to the brink, there was a time when I didn't even submit the final project, because I knew I already had enough marks to pass.

# Internship
I made a big decision to pivot into Web Development for my internship (Integrated Work Study Program), and ended up joining PSA International as a Full-stack Engineer Intern.

I learned quite a bit about the "other side" of Software Engineering, JavaScript frameworks like Angular, backend frameworks like Spring, legacy tech (looking at you, Weblogic), CI/CD, DevOps, Unit Testing, etc, etc.
It was overwhelming, yet exhilarating, I greatly enjoyed using my new-found knowledge as I went about my work, even if it wasn't the so-called best way to do things (my mentor always encouraged me to keep it simple, and in hindsight, he was always right).

## Cancer
Half-way through my internship, I was diagnosed with stage 4 colorectal cancer, sucks doesn't it. I suffered frequent bouts of dizziness and light-headedness, especially when exerting myself. I struggled to climb stairs, or walk quickly.

I honestly thought I was just too fat, but it turns out that I suffered from serious anemia, and was leaking blood constantly from my colon. I ended up getting surgery and then going through chemotherapy (still am btw).

Anyway, my school and company gracefully let me graduate without fully completing my capstone project.

Dealing with cancer has been difficult, it's hard to wonder how one can be so unlucky, but ultimately, I've come to terms with it. 

Although not all the factors are clear, I am now fairly certain that my previously unhealthy lifestyle greatly exacerbated the development of the cancer.

That, in combination with my general ignorance, led to things being much worse than it could have been. Now, I am a firm believer in the philosophy of "food is medicine", and pretty much avoid ultra-processed junk like it's the plague.

Take care of your body, for health truly is wealth.

# RATH
After getting cancer, an old GAM-mate reached out to me, asking for help with programming some tech for his indie game studio. This opportunity felt like a silver lining in the face of my rather grim situation, and so I jumped into it immediately.

Although I was working entirely voluntarily, I appreciated the opportunity to continue honing my technical skills, while picking up game development and design techniques from my more design-oriented peers.

## Jack of all Tech, Master of Nothing
Up until today, I find great difficultly in choosing one specialization to stick to.

Although game development is my main passion, I still enjoy developing in other fields too. Like this blog, for example.

I have a bad habit of starting unfinished projects, projects that typically start out strong, then fizzle out quickly, like gas from a soda.

Either way, life marches on, and I will keep going, to be the best version of myself that I can ever be.

# TLDR
Never get complacent.

## Fun facts
1. This post was initially written when I was in the hospital doing chemotherapy. I used GitHub codespaces, and while not the perfect writing experience, it was adequate to pen down my thoughts and see it be deployed.
