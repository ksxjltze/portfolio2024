I started blogging because I felt that my website would be too empty otherwise, but now I've come to enjoy the mere act of writing down my nonsensical thoughts.

Writing a blog is kinda therapeutic, it calms the mind and distracts me from the need to stop being unemployed.

Is writing a blog a productive use of my time? Probably not.
