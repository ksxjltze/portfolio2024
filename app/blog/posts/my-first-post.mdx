summary: 'What is a good portfolio website?'
---

This is my third portfolio website. Why did I choose to make a third one? 

The previous website was getting too cluttered, and did not feel very professional. It was becoming more of a personal website instead of a professional portfolio.

The one before that was too amateurish, reflecting my skill in web development at the time.

What do I want to do with this website? I just hope it makes my skills shine bright.
