I love mushrooms, especially portobello mushrooms, they're so meaty, umami, and outright delicious, I could eat them every day.

## Sautéed Portobello Mushrooms
Here's the way that I usually prepare and cook my mushrooms:
1. Cut off the mushroom stems.
2. Scrape off the gills.
3. Rinse briefly in water.
4. Put the mushrooms straight, whole, into a skillet, no oil, medium-high heat.
5. Let the mushrooms sit in the pan for 3-5 minutes, until they stop releasing water.
6. Add garlic/butter/oil/spices into the pan and stir until fragrant or the garlic starts turning brown.
7. Garnish with fresh herbs and salt to taste.
8. Serve with a dash of olive oil or sesame oil.

## Simple Mushroom Sauce:
Optionally, you can go a bit further after sautéing to make a sauce of sorts:
1. Add a bit of water and some vinegar to deglaze.
2. Make sure to get all of that delicious mushroom fond.
3. Turn to low heat and let simmer until the mushrooms absorb the sauce, to desired consistency.

## Why Eat Mushrooms
They're really good for you.
