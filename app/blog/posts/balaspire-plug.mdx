# New Game
I guess now's a good a time as any to plug the game I've been working on at RATHSOFT.

## Introducing: Balaspire
**Balaspire**, yes, the name is a literal mashup between the two widely popular roguelike card games. 

We take the deck-building and synergistic elements of Slay the Spire, and combine it with the addictive gambling/poker aspects of Balatro, and boom, totally original new game. 

Get your gambling dopamine fix! Wishlist Balaspire on steam now!

## Why should I play your ripoff?
It has cute animals, and it's really satisfying to see big numbers go boom.

Number go up, never gets old.

Pls wishlist.
