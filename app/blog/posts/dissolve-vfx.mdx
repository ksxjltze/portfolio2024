If you've ever played Genshin Impact, you might have noticed how characters "Unequip" their weapons in this cool burst of particles.
Strike a cool pose, throw your sword into the air and have it turn into dust, beautiful.

## How I started
Like I'm sure many of my tech bro peers would do, I asked Claude and DeepSeek: "how does genshin do it's disappearing weapon vfx?"
I got back a pretty detailed and convincing answer, involving Dissolve Shaders, Particle Systems, Trail Renderers, Animation Synchronization, etc.

It even gave me some code to go along with its answer, but to challenge myself, I decided to create the shader from scratch using ShaderGraph.

This little endeavour taught me about the concept of using a noise texture to "erode" the rendered output of a shader.

WIP:
- Using a noise texture as a mask
- Alpha clipping
- VFX Graph
- Faking it til you make it

## Really Simple Dissolve VFX

If you look closely, this effect doesn't do the exact same thing as the Genshin effect, but it does have a similar feel.
